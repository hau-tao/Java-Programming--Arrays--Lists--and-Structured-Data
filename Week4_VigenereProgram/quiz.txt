5. 
Recall that the choice to test key lengths 1–100 was arbitrary, and that the longer a key is with respect to an encrypted message, the less likely this Vigenère decryption algorithm is to work.

How long would a key have to be, so that you could gain no information about an original message by analyzing the encrypted message



There is no key length that ensures an unbreakable Vigenère implementation.
1/26
